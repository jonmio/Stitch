# Stitch
A personally-tailored friendship manager that prevents you from falling out of touch with people you care about.

How?
----

Stitch monitors your most recent social interactions with contacts of your choice. If you start to fall out of touch with them, Stitch will notify you via text or email. If you continue to ignore these reminders, Stitch will directly reach out to the contact on your behalf, starting the conversation for you. This makes it impossible to fall out of touch with your contacts... (assuming they actually want to talk to you too)!
