# Stitch
A personally-tailored friendship manager that prevents you from falling out of touch with people you care about.

How?
----

Remindr monitors your most recent social interactions with contacts of your choice. If you start to fall out of touch with them, Remindr will notify you via text or email. If you continue to ignore these reminders, Remindr will directly reach out to the contact on your behalf, starting the conversation for you. This makes it impossible to fall out of touch with your contacts... (assuming they actually want to talk to you too)!
